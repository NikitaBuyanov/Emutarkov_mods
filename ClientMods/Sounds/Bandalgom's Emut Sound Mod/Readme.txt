Bandalgom's EmuT Sound Mod 0.0.1

Function : Changes some shitty sounds of certain guns to waaa~aaay better one.

What is changed? 

1. Shitty beta AK74 sound -> to Alpha ver. AK74 sound. 

Actually I couldn't get data from Alpha client since audio data of alpha version client were encrypted. 
This is based on youtube video recording of alpha version Tarkov so it may be worse than actual alpha experience. I tried my best effort to make similar sound.

2. Shitty short HK416 sound -> Muuuch better MDR sound. (speed up 130% to follow up higher RPM)


Installation

Copy - Paste EscapeFromTarkov_Data folder into basic directory (where .exe files of game client is located)

Making backup of original files is highly recommended.
