How to install Tan Gen2 Khyber v1.0 by Drill

You will be replacing a file in your game folder. I highly suggest you make a copy of the file that the one in this zip will be replacing so that you can revert back to the original.


-Tan Gen2 Khyber: pants_usec_gen2.bundle

Copy and paste this file into "\EscapeFromTarkov_Data\StreamingAssets\Windows\assets\content\characters\character\prefabs"
