# [private] -- Renamed Bots

This mod provides random English names to replace the 1,786 random Russian names for bots in [private].
Currently bot modding is not implemented, so you will need to copy this mod directly 
into the DB/bots folders. The names list is compiled from [private] Twitch Streamers and the [private] Leaderboards.

I personally only use these names to replace the USEC/BEAR PMC names, but it should work
if you wanted to use these in place of the Russian Scav names as well.
