### AssAssIn-HiddenItems-124r2.1.1
heres the hiddenItems mod. its got the helmet flashlight holders and the new silencer. silencer has limited texture, and occasionally show muzzle flash; guessing becuase of incomplete texturing. bundle file for the micro h1 shows a doge so its not in here. and the gasmask creates an unknown "moving error" when buying... its out for now too.
