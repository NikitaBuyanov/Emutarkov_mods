"Good work, dodger- listen to me, carefully. I need you to bring me a particular weapon- a Colt M4A1 with a 370mm barrel, a Colt buffer tube and a Colt charging handle, a tan Magpul CTR carbine stock, a tan M3 30 FDE magazine, a MIAD pistol grip, a Daniel Defense RIS II 12.25 handguard, an ST-6012 flash hider and a low-profile MK12 gas block. Make sure it's got a tan EOTech EXPS3, and a Magpul AFG in FDE... and that it all comes from the Laboratory. It'd be great if all of it came from there- then I'd be certain it's all compatible with what I want to do. Get moving, buddy!"
