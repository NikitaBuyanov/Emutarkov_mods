"So, buddy, you're back- ready for a mission? Perfect. It turns out that I could get external access to TerraGroup's servers, but those spooks managed to lock them down tight with jammers. You're going to go in there and get rid of them- so bring a good kit with you and pack a lunch: you're gonna' need it. I should be able to use those jammers for other things, if you bring them back, to get started."
