"Congratulations! Those jammers were doing some nasty work, but thanks to your efforts, I've got the wiggle-room I needed to get into and around TerraGroup's systems. Together, we can make a hell of a profit- and I'll be able to prepare for you some stuff that was intended for some of their Special Forces contractors. They should allow you to get a leg up on others looking to unearth the secrets of TerraGroup."
