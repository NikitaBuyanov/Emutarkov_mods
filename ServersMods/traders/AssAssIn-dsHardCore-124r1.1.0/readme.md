For players who want a massive challenge and much longer, more punishing gameplay.

This mod recreates the rules of DeadlySlobs Hardcore challenge, instead of you enforcing the rules on yourself

Hardcore Season 5 Rules:
1. No Flea Market.
2. No Scavenger Raids. **```(This one u have to abide yourself)```**
3. You cannot purchase equipment from Dealers with money. You are allowed to Barter for equipment.
4. Secure container only for keys. (you can keep keytool/sicc-/docs-case inside and these can still be used)
5. Cash stack can be used to purchase armor repairs & any container.
6. Cash stack can be used to complete missions.
7. Mission specific items (Markers, Jammers, Cameras...) can be bought using cash stack.
8. You can insure items using cash stack.

*NEW RULES*
9. Items required for hideout upgrades must be either crafted in the hideout or found in raid.
10. You can craft in the hideout.

Money Changes:
11. In-raid & Task money can be used in the "Global Cash Stack"
12. Money obtained from leveling Dealer Reputations will no longer need deleted. It will now be stored and added to the "Global Cash Stack" to be used for Hideout Upgrades that require money. You can exchange RUB - USD - EUR however you see fit.

*NEW* Global Cash Stack:
Given changes with the money storage in containers, it is far more simplistic and fair to have the money obtained from reputation farm, in raid and tasks be combined for Clothing Upgrades, Hideout Upgrades and Armor Repair.
